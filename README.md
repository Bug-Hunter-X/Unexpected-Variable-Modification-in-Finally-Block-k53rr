# Java Uncommon Bug: Unexpected Variable Modification in Finally Block

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Java related to the behavior of the `finally` block in exception handling.  The issue arises when a variable is modified within the `finally` block after an exception is caught. This modification can overwrite changes expected to be preserved from before the exception handling block.

## The Problem
The core issue lies in the assumption that variables remain unchanged after being handled by a `catch` block.  However, the `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. If the `finally` block modifies a variable, that modification may be unexpected or undesirable.

## Reproducing the Bug
The `UncommonBug.java` file contains code that demonstrates this behavior. An `ArithmeticException` is caught, but the `finally` block modifies the variable `x`, leading to an output different than what might be intuitively expected.

## Solution
The `UncommonBugSolution.java` file shows a possible solution. A more robust way to handle this scenario is to avoid modifying variables in the `finally` block if it's not absolutely necessary.  The solution shows how to make code less error-prone.
